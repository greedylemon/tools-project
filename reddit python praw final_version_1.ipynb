      "I don't know much about nanotech or 3D printing, but solar has been following the same arc as computers back in the '90s: A sector that has been growing enormously overall, while almost all the companies in it are crushed by the murderous competition on price. Seriously, if you built a factory that can make money building panels at $0.50/watt and all of a sudden the competition is selling at $0.45/watt, you've got problems. And EVERYONE is building factories. (There was a point in the '90s when there were three generations of memory chips for sale and everyone was losing money on all three generations.) \n",

Sarcasm is fine but if you want my honest opinion, this will continue to down trend till it uplists are get news of powerclouds in US. Can you tell me how this is a bad business model at all? They buy and install massive solar fields, paid for by the public or whoever wants to buy a solar panel with a rate of return per year, get 300K for every powercloud and a portion of the profits continuously once the powercloud is set up. \n",

      "This is a very difficult question.  At the peak of the oil prices in 2014, there was a huge push for renewable energy sources.  Additionally, the US began to enter the oil export business thanks to oil-shale production.  I think both of these trends pissed off OPEC and they decided to flush the market with oil to make alternative production (i.e. oil-shale) unprofitable and alleviate the drive for alternative energy.\n",
      "I don't think alternative energy has slowed down much (rapidly approaching levels of coal production and becoming cheaper every year), but coupled with the influx of supply and the diminishing demand from the hyper-industrialized China and US, the price is likely to stay low for the foreseeable future and not rebound as rapidly as it has in the past (many years as opposed to weeks or months).\n",
      "I personally hate the fact that the global economies are so attached to the price of oil -- it fucks everything else up when a small set of rich nations decide to manipulate prices.  Fuck them -- I'm out for good and I personally hope it doesn't recover.\n",
      "Not that I actually have any real knowledge about the subject, but my assumption is that this isn't something to worry about.  Here's my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The current price of crude has been significantly affected by the competitive practices of several large oil nations (the Saudis are the ones that come to mind first, but the recent reductions in Iran's sanctions mean that the Iranians will likely export more oil in the near future as well).  This means that once the goal of the competitive pricing is accomplished (namely driving smaller operations like the US natural gas industry out of the arena), the prices are likely to rise again.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Though electric cars (transportation accounts for about half of oil use worldwide) are coming, it's unlikely that they will make up a significant portion of the approximately 1 billion cars on the road today.  According to [an IEA report from 2013](https://www.iea.org/publications/globalevoutlook_2013.pdf) (which I assume understates things significantly), we're looking at roughly 2% of the global passenger vehicle fleet becoming electric by 2020. What does this mean further in the future? I'm not quite sure, but I'm fairly certain that in a 10-15 year timeframe, we won't see half of the world's cars become electric.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Worldwide demand for oil is still on the rise.  According to the [IEA's Oil Reoprt](https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/), demand has risen a few percent over the past few years, despite all the talk of the emerging \"green\" economy.  This trend is likely to continue, even if the green economy takes off in developed nations, as industrialization and growth continue in the Middle East and Southeast Asia over the next decade or two (or possibly more - like I said, I'm not really an authority on all this).\n",

      "Cars now get much higher gas mileage than they used to, meaning theoretically they use less oil? This is all just speculation as I do not really know. cars use to get 15-25mpg and now most new cars get 25-35mpg. Oil changes used to be needed done every 3k miles but now 5k-7k miles between changes isnt all that uncommon either.\n",

These classes will teach you how to solve a problem in the most efficient way possible based on how computers make sense of information. You won't be able to use theory to create applications, however. Many workplaces will expect a lot of hands-on time with what their shop uses.

      "There seems to be a lot of confusion in this thread. SGLB is not dependent on 3D printers for home use for their primary source of income. They are developing AM technology for metal printing in the aerospace industry. It doesn't matter if nobody here plans on printing anything at home. Any company in the aerospace industry has to move to AM in the near future if they want to be competitive. The next generation of high tech engine parts will not even be able to be produced through traditional manufacturing techniques. This is why SGLB is doing better than other 3D companies. They are a different kind of animal altogether.\n",

I have bought shares in hope to capitalize on the hopefully large jump in pps that is made if they can commercialize as their product is in demand.

      "I'm not sure what you personally would use a printer for at home, but the industrial type applications for use of these would be extremely beneficial. Quality of the print is very important and could save lots of time in the builds of complex parts. Saving time = saving money, as well as being able to build higher complexity into designs. And that is done through the software. Think automotive, aerospace, and agriculture equipment industries. All big money makers looking for a technology like this. I don't see a big need for printers to be in individuals homes for a while. I see it being commercialized in a store like a Kinkos or something.\n",

      "You are getting down voted for this because this has nothing to do with sigma labs. Before you come into a post and bash a company, do some research. Sigma labs works hand in hand with GE to begin 3D printing components for jet engines and gas turbines. Their goal is to start manufacturing nozzles and use sigma labs technology for this. Additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry is seen purely as a massive cost reduction but the issue is that when you manufacture it using this technology there are flaws within the material that are unknown. Sigma labs develops an inspection software for additive manufacturing to see these flaws. 3d printing a nozzle or a case or a turbine blade will reduce costs drastically. This company has nothing to do with printing anything from your home.\n",
      "With your simple question you're neglecting the fact that people have different needs. You might only have needed it twice, I might never use it, but the guy below me might need to print material on a regular basis. 3D printing is real, it's here to stay, and it'll be a big part of the future. Regular printers will probably die out once 3D printers become more common.  \n",

This might be a viable component of the manufacturing industry in 5-10 years but right now I wouldn't touch any 3D printing stocks. As for home use, I have no idea what I would need a 3D printer for except for maybe hobbies or play use, making it more of a luxury item.\n",

      "I work in an industry where we commonly require custom-made parts for replacement in industrial equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently we use mills, drills and lathes (generally) to modify steel peices. Thing about 3D printers is this:\n",
      "\n",
      "- You want to use them to replace uncommon parts, so you figure it would save a lot of money over buying them.\n",
      "- Well, if a lot of people need uncommon parts, someone has made 100,000+ units for that exact purpose. Or, more often, parts are generic (bolts, nuts, etc.)\n",
      "- Secondly, you have to **design** 3D parts. This means a shitload of money for someone who has this skill, as an employee if you need them often. Well now, there goes my labour-savings to make those 3-4 little replacement parts that will take my machinist one half day. It's going to take my designer one full day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So as far as these things go... The **problem** is that in one-off scenarios, using existing or cheaper equipment to make stuff (if you don't have a design for it) is a cheaper solution since design is **really** expensive. *and secondly,* mass-scale production or even medium-scale assembly production beats out the cost 3D printing no problem.\n",

Statasys has been making 3-D printers for over a decade and you'd be hard pressed to find a design engineering group that doesn't have at least one in their building.

      "I disagree.  GE is already investing millions into making thousands of new fuel nozzles for their next gen engine with additive manufacturing.  After that production run is complete they can immediately reuse the 3D printers for some other part.  If a new nozzle needs to be made in Beijing they can use any 3D printer that prints to the same or better tolerances than the original printer rather than waiting for a part to fly in from Ohio, all they need is the original CAD and QA files from GE.  Hell a GE engineer could probably oversee the printing of the replacement part remotely.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a machinist but have worked with shops to make custom parts and instruments.  To create the parts we needed they had to design the part with CAD software because that's what the CNC mill needed to operate.  I don't buy your design argument because that has to be done anyways using software that creates output that should be compatible.  Some day instead of mills the parts will be made with printers.  \n",

I also own CIMT and ONVO but am averaged much lower than their current prices, and would have a hard time paying today's price for either. CIMT is probably worth it in the long run, but it's hard to say if ONVO will ever accomplish their lofty goals. I sure hope they can though, it's worth reading up on all they do. Cool stuff! One last stock to consider if you want to swing for the fences, SGLB (more on /r/SGLB) is partnered up with some solid companies and has a software that can help everyone in the 3D market. It's risky as hell, but if they succeed in launching PrintRite3D and it's well embraced by the industry as I think it will be, the eagle is going to seriously fly here. Hope that helps, and sorry I didn't have time to go into more about each company but you can research them each and find out what works for you. \n",

No news or bad news it will slowly sink back down to 0.1 or lower over the next couple months.  From someone who has done hands on research in industries with which require very precise manufacturing tolerances and a very big focus on quality, I personally see huge potential in SGLB's work within the emerging world of additive manufacturing.  I have more than just play money invested in this one.\n",

An extremely huge milestone is upon us when the KOL (key opinion leaders) provide feedback to Organovo's first commercial product (3D liver tissue assay).

The technological improvement you see in 3D printers sold to the public lags behind what industrial printers have been able to do for quite a while. The gold rush is pretty much over. Prices are tumbling due to strong competition and now even printer manufacturers like Canon and Ricoh are working on commoditizing 3D printing.

Personally, the plays I like other than DDD would be HPQ and MTLS. HPQ has the money to be the go to in this business, I'm curious to see if the new split up company can capitalize on it. At least you get some dividends there too and a damn fine pps right now (I'd still wait until after 3rd quarter earnings the week of the 23rd - 27th though).

      "On top of all of this, you have major lending regulations which are affecting the banks’ ability to lend to real estate investors. Moreover, there is a limited-to-nonexistent secondary mortgage market meaning the banks generally hold the loans they make (MBSs are still an option). Mortgages in Aus are generally 5 or 7 year ARMs which means a rise in interest rates or drop in property values from new lending regulations, or changes to the tax code such as a change in negative gearing, could drastically harm the bank’s balance sheets and cash flow. \n",

      "Bcaz many foreign markets have higher yields than the 2&#37; or so on the S&P 500. Very high dividend yields like with the Aussie banks are a bit rare but still understandable since Australia is known for high payouts and the concept of franking credits to dividends. Others like Canadian banks do not have very high yields. Banks in Chile and Colombia for example have higher yields than the US because they are emerging markets and Chilean firms have to payout a good portion of earnings as dividends by law. So I would analyze the reason for higher dividends than assuming very high dividends are not a concern.\n",
      "Sure. I agree the shareprice is the NPV of future cashflows. But just because share prices drop does not mean dividends are at risk \\- especially for well established consistent payers. You can check out any of the Canadian banks for example. I can give other examples proving this point over the weekend.\n",
      "Sure. But there are firms that have high dividends and continue to maintain the rate if not increase it in a rising rate environment. For instance, there are many dividend aristocrats that have increased dividend for years but the rate is still low.  Starting with a low rate\\(base\\) and increasing each year is worse than high dividends as base and a small rise each year or maintaining that rate with occasional increases.\n",

      "Additionally, where does the idea come from that Australian companies are known for high dividends? Being an Australian company doesn’t mean high yield — higher yields for Aussie companies may be a recent reality due to the substantial amount of mining and energy companies which had seen record earnings, but the higher yields isn’t some magical result of being an Australian company. \n",
      "drop in shareprices means that either expected cashflows gets lower or discount rate gets higher, yes?\n",
      "I don’t think you’re grasping the risk analysis being identified by many of the comments here. Simply because the RBA projects growth does not mean that the Australian economy can’t take a major hit, or the bank stocks particularly won’t take a hit given a specific event. The RBA’s projections do not account for potential legislative changes which may have drastic affects on the housing market, or other geopolitical issues which may directly impact the Aussie economy. \n",

Outside of certain areas of Western Australia and Queensland, public support is strongly moving away from mining and towards renewables. The recent Adani mine failure is a major concern for the mining sector in Australia. Specifically, the reasons the mine failed are the most concerning: open public opposition placing political pressure and Australian banks refusing to lend on ethical grounds. \n",

      "On the banking side, the banks have major exposure to the housing market which is currently facing significant uncertainty, and may have earnings cut drastically following legislative reforms relating to (i) investment real estate, (ii) negative gearing, and (iii) the Royal Commission. Legislative changes to (i) or (ii) could place substantial strain on the housing market which would have a direct negative impact on the banks. Outcomes relating to (iii) may have a direct impact on the banks’ business models which could reduce earnings for the long-term — reducing both share price and the dividend.\n",

In a simplified brief explanation, I had bet that the FED will not raise rates and that Yellen would speak in a Dovish tone in regards to rates. Austrian economists would agree that there is only a slight chance for a rate hike considering the circumstances of the economy. Yellen had bluffed many times before, and the time in March would not have been any different considering the economic fundamentals at the time. While the market had bet that they would either raise or speak of raising it soon, it was the opposite. You could tell the markets were wrong because they seemed to have priced in the rate hike in gold, oil and other commodities, but they were wrong and you could see from  how aggressively Gold and Oil capitulated to the upside, from which I took my profits.\n",

I prefer ATM if/when I do anything these days.  Back then I did plenty of earnings plays, but I am very much against that now as the premiums are too high.  It's better to buy AFTER earnings these days on stocks that aren't moving as high/low as they should be... buying before too many large funds add much of it to their portfolios as they see the company gaining traction ahead of estimates.  As an example: you see EXPE trading higher today in a down market after earnings last week... almost a double on options using weeklies.  Of course you could also easily lose 100% on it too, especially with weeklies.\n",
