      "Aussie Banks are going through a royal commission (a major ad-hoc formal public inquiry) at the moment, and it isn't due to finish until February of next year. There is the possibility (not a significant one at current, but the commission could result in a few curve balls being thrown) that the banks may cut dividends in order to protect their balance sheets, pending the outcome of the royal commission.\n",
      "I lived in New Zealand back in 2008-2010 and 1 year CD’s were upwards of 10-12% per year. Made some good money at the time! Even now their rates are much higher than anything you’d get in the US. \n",
      "if the 6% yields are divided, how much do you actually end up with?\n",
      "[deleted]\n",
      "Too high divided yields is not good. It is usually a strategy (trap) companies use to attract investors when the company is in bad shape or structural problems.\n",
      "you say you don't care about decreasing shareprices because you own for the income, but falling shareprices means expectations of lower or riskier income...\n",
      "Considering yields will continue to rise in the US these seem like very unattractive investments to US investors. \n",
      "To me, the income is not worth the risk of the current royal commission inquiry. You can get the same yield buying a US based mortgage REIT while minimizing the risk of share depreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like [BXMT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BXMT?p=BXMT). They offer *floating rate* mortgages backed by commercial real estate. If you feel good about the US economy as I do, it's a no brainer. As US LIBOR increases they're able to raise the interest rates of their loans, generating greater revenues. Moreover, they are run by the same management team as The Blackstone Group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, they yield about ~7.85%, but if you purchase during a sell off your yield on cost could be higher. I purchased during Brexit sell off and my yield on cost is ~9.50%. And my shares have appreciated ~21% since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it's about diversification and you really need to own a bank I like BAC and JPM. In the financials more broadly I like PYPL, GPN, V, MA, AMTD, & SCHW\n",
      "\n",
      "Long BXMT, PYPL, V, BAC\n",
      "Aussie here. Been watching Aussie banks and my caveat would be it's impossible to predict anything but IMHO, the Aussie banks are only at fair value at the moment with potential downside risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would be very interested in them if they drop more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again, I make no claims to being an expert. Just my thoughts .\n",
      "some of those banks are embroiled in scandals right? we those addressed already?\n",
      "Ironically in Australia we look at these yields \"grossed up\" for franking credits. So effectively if you are a middle income earning in Australia you are getting more like 9% yield and yet the consensus is still \"stay away\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Tempting though, I remember in 2011 things looked quite bad but the banks were a good buy then.\n",
      "Just a little heads up. The Australian housing market is about to implode. Debt to income looks scary like scary as never seen before , not even in America. Melbourne,  Sidney and the large metropolitan areas are in the early stages of a housing crash. I know because I do freelance work for vulture funds and guess where they are setting up right now ? That's right , Australia.  If anything people should be shorting the Australian banks  and homebuilders.  Just my 2cent worth. \n",
      "Dividends look great, but how's the economy in Australia? Getting better at all? If the price keeps dropping, I don't see how the dividends income can cover the loss in price.\n",
      "My dad did this and will be deducting a capital loss of 3k for the rest of his life due to currency exchange losses. \n",
      "Please heed u/Bazzlow’s comment. Right now is a rather uncertain time for the major banks in Aus. The Royal Commission is underway and will continue to be for almost a full year. \n",
      "\n",
      "The outcome of the Commission could mean a change in business practices for the banks, and thus a decrease in earnings. Buying in because of a high dividend caused by the share price dropping due to the Commission is a risky endeavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "On top of all of this, you have major lending regulations which are affecting the banks’ ability to lend to real estate investors. Moreover, there is a limited-to-nonexistent secondary mortgage market meaning the banks generally hold the loans they make (MBSs are still an option). Mortgages in Aus are generally 5 or 7 year ARMs which means a rise in interest rates or drop in property values from new lending regulations, or changes to the tax code such as a change in negative gearing, could drastically harm the bank’s balance sheets and cash flow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these banks aren’t some safe haven to get free money in the form of dividends. They come with tremendous risk given the current happenings in Aus. Please understand the market the banks operate in rather than just seeing “high dividend” before investing. \n",
      "RemindMe! 10 months\n",
      "While it's still an uncertain future, I should point out that banks have already begun passing on the expense of complying with new regulation onto customers (rather than shareholders). \n",
      "Can foreigners open accounts?  I’m in the good ole USA if that matters.\n",
      "What do you mean by divided?\n",
      "Yep. Sweden has higher dividend yields than the US but taxes for US investors is a drain.\n",
      "That's true but does not apply to all companies especially in overseas markets.\n",
      "In the US yes, but in overseas markets it's not the same.\n",
      "Not necessarily. Share prices go up and down all the time for any number of reasons. This does not mean investors are expecting lower or riskier income down the road.\n",
      "Thats a valid point. But can be used for diversification purposes\n",
      "Agree. Owing a REIT is not the same owning a bank for obvious reasons. However Aussie banks are not going to collapse because of the inquiry like Wachovia or National City. But risk is there in further share price declines but again income investors own for the income.\n",
      "Same here. May add more if there are further declines.\n",
      "Yes. We are discussing the impacts.\n",
      "Hmm. Valid points. But I wouldn't short Aussie banks unless you are willing to take huge risks. For a retail investors shorting in general should be avoided. They have been saying the housing market in Canada and Australia was gonna crash for a long time now....\n",
      "Australia hasn't had a recession (growth of less than 2.0%) in over 30 years.\n",
      "These companies trade on american exchanges....\n",
      "As an analogy check out Thorn Group (TGA).TGA own a credit business (Radio Rentals). Following an investigation by the local regulator their credit assessment procedures were found to be inadequate (using a benchmark for expenses as opposed to actual verification). Since getting their processes up to scratch this has had a large impact on their ability to process credit applications efficiently (hence the growth of their loan book and earnings).\n",

      "I know.  I agree investors in some developed markets outside of the US are lucky. \n",
      "Bcaz many foreign markets have higher yields than the 2&#37; or so on the S&P 500. Very high dividend yields like with the Aussie banks are a bit rare but still understandable since Australia is known for high payouts and the concept of franking credits to dividends. Others like Canadian banks do not have very high yields. Banks in Chile and Colombia for example have higher yields than the US because they are emerging markets and Chilean firms have to payout a good portion of earnings as dividends by law. So I would analyze the reason for higher dividends than assuming very high dividends are not a concern.\n",
      "Sure. I agree the shareprice is the NPV of future cashflows. But just because share prices drop does not mean dividends are at risk \\- especially for well established consistent payers. You can check out any of the Canadian banks for example. I can give other examples proving this point over the weekend.\n",
      "Sure. But there are firms that have high dividends and continue to maintain the rate if not increase it in a rising rate environment. For instance, there are many dividend aristocrats that have increased dividend for years but the rate is still low.  Starting with a low rate\\(base\\) and increasing each year is worse than high dividends as base and a small rise each year or maintaining that rate with occasional increases.\n",

      "Omg I think I just saw civil, positive, open minded reception of constructive criticism on Reddit \n",
      "Could you please expand upon your reasoning? \n",
      "You do realize that franking credits apply to the shareholders tax burden, not the yield of the dividend? Franking credits do not impact the amount of the dividend paid to the shareholder; they affect the tax paid by the shareholder on the dividend payout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, where does the idea come from that Australian companies are known for high dividends? Being an Australian company doesn’t mean high yield — higher yields for Aussie companies may be a recent reality due to the substantial amount of mining and energy companies which had seen record earnings, but the higher yields isn’t some magical result of being an Australian company. \n",
      "drop in shareprices means that either expected cashflows gets lower or discount rate gets higher, yes?\n",
      "I don’t think you’re grasping the risk analysis being identified by many of the comments here. Simply because the RBA projects growth does not mean that the Australian economy can’t take a major hit, or the bank stocks particularly won’t take a hit given a specific event. The RBA’s projections do not account for potential legislative changes which may have drastic affects on the housing market, or other geopolitical issues which may directly impact the Aussie economy. \n",

      "**Edit:** For clarity’s sake, I want to be clear that I’m not trying to be an argumentative troll on Reddit. Due to a few unforeseen events, my life had inextricably been tied to Australia. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are significant risks to certain Australian industries at the moment — particularly mining and banking. Outside of certain areas of Western Australia and Queensland, public support is strongly moving away from mining and towards renewables. The recent Adani mine failure is a major concern for the mining sector in Australia. Specifically, the reasons the mine failed are the most concerning: open public opposition placing political pressure and Australian banks refusing to lend on ethical grounds. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the banking side, the banks have major exposure to the housing market which is currently facing significant uncertainty, and may have earnings cut drastically following legislative reforms relating to (i) investment real estate, (ii) negative gearing, and (iii) the Royal Commission. Legislative changes to (i) or (ii) could place substantial strain on the housing market which would have a direct negative impact on the banks. Outcomes relating to (iii) may have a direct impact on the banks’ business models which could reduce earnings for the long-term — reducing both share price and the dividend.\n",

      "Lol. I did not know that it was that bad on here. Maybe I am in the wrong place. :-)\n",
      "Yes I am aware of that. Unlike Australian firms, US companies' earnings are subject to double taxation. Companies pay taxes on earnings first and then the dividends paid out to investors are taxed again at the individual tax rate level.\n",

      "* Since '90, SPX avg yr has 134 days that trade in a range >1%. The 6 this yr is astronomically out of proportion. 39 in '93 is the record.\n",

Austrian economists would agree that there is only a slight chance for a rate hike considering the circumstances of the economy. Yellen had bluffed many times before, and the time in March would not have been any different considering the economic fundamentals at the time. While the market had bet that they would either raise or speak of raising it soon, it was the opposite.
