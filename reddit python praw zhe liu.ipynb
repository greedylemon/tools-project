      "There seems to be a lot of confusion in this thread. SGLB is not dependent on 3D printers for home use for their primary source of income. They are developing AM technology for metal printing in the aerospace industry. It doesn't matter if nobody here plans on printing anything at home. Any company in the aerospace industry has to move to AM in the near future if they want to be competitive. The next generation of high tech engine parts will not even be able to be produced through traditional manufacturing techniques. This is why SGLB is doing better than other 3D companies. They are a different kind of animal altogether.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I almost fell to the hype until I thought of a simple question for myself. In the last 30 days how often would I use a 3D printer if I had one? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My answer was probably around twice. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think 3D printers will be as famous or in every household as the industry tries to push it. \n",
      "I bought about 35k stocks yesterday and am seeing upwards of 10% gains already.  Sigma labs is going to have a web conference on May 1, and, from this article, I believe it will be beneficial to their share price. \n",

      "I work in the aerospace industry, you sir are in fact correct! Any aerospace company not searching for additive manufacturing will not be able to compete. The amount of money spent on manufacturing parts is ungodly, and a waste. The labor spent on that can easily be replaced my 3D printing, and will, and it will greatly reduce manufacturing costs which take up a large majority of the cost that go into putting together a gas turbine or jet engine. Sigma labs product is exactly what this industry needs, anyone who cannot see this is truly missing out.\n",
      "There's one thing that's very, very straightforward in this thread:\n",
      "\n",
      "/u/3DPrintingStocks linked to http://3dprintingstocks.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's about as transparent as it gets.\n",
      "\n",
      "/u/Youareme2's analysis makes the *motives* of the OP pretty murky, but at least he's honest about self-promotion.\n",
      "Agree with all of your points. This stocks only value lies in the hope that they get their main product, printrite 3d, commercialized. Without that it's worthless. I have bought shares in hope to capitalize on the hopefully large jump in pps that is made if they can commercialize as their product is in demand. However, they could easily go bankrupt beforehand or the product could fail. It's all a gamble and the technical indicators don't really give any insight into this. It's all just day traders riding the hype up and down anyway. \n",
      "He's been on r/stocks for a while now and said he doesn't work for anyone. He's praised other companies too. My opinion is that its just a guy that made that site to help tide the stocks to his benefit. \n",
      "I'm not sure what you personally would use a printer for at home, but the industrial type applications for use of these would be extremely beneficial. Quality of the print is very important and could save lots of time in the builds of complex parts. Saving time = saving money, as well as being able to build higher complexity into designs. And that is done through the software. Think automotive, aerospace, and agriculture equipment industries. All big money makers looking for a technology like this. I don't see a big need for printers to be in individuals homes for a while. I see it being commercialized in a store like a Kinkos or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the quality improvements through this type of software isn't meant for you to personally use at home. Cheap printers can provide the quality you need today. But like I said, it depends on what you want to do with it. Industrial use vs. Personal/home use. \n",
      "I'm going to quote you in about 30 years. Sounds to me like the \"There is a world market for about five computers.\" remark\n",
      "You are getting down voted for this because this has nothing to do with sigma labs. Before you come into a post and bash a company, do some research. Sigma labs works hand in hand with GE to begin 3D printing components for jet engines and gas turbines. Their goal is to start manufacturing nozzles and use sigma labs technology for this. Additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry is seen purely as a massive cost reduction but the issue is that when you manufacture it using this technology there are flaws within the material that are unknown. Sigma labs develops an inspection software for additive manufacturing to see these flaws. 3d printing a nozzle or a case or a turbine blade will reduce costs drastically. This company has nothing to do with printing anything from your home.\n",
      "With your simple question you're neglecting the fact that people have different needs. You might only have needed it twice, I might never use it, but the guy below me might need to print material on a regular basis. 3D printing is real, it's here to stay, and it'll be a big part of the future. Regular printers will probably die out once 3D printers become more common.  \n",
      "I've no idea how you're getting downvoted for this.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It is quite apparent that the 3D printing industry got overhyped and overvalued, and now it's bleeding red. This might be a viable component of the manufacturing industry in 5-10 years but right now I wouldn't touch any 3D printing stocks. As for home use, I have no idea what I would need a 3D printer for except for maybe hobbies or play use, making it more of a luxury item.\n",
      "I'm betting on SpaceX buying them out at some point.\n",
      "I work in an industry where we commonly require custom-made parts for replacement in industrial equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently we use mills, drills and lathes (generally) to modify steel peices. Thing about 3D printers is this:\n",
      "\n",
      "- You want to use them to replace uncommon parts, so you figure it would save a lot of money over buying them.\n",
      "- Well, if a lot of people need uncommon parts, someone has made 100,000+ units for that exact purpose. Or, more often, parts are generic (bolts, nuts, etc.)\n",
      "- Secondly, you have to **design** 3D parts. This means a shitload of money for someone who has this skill, as an employee if you need them often. Well now, there goes my labour-savings to make those 3-4 little replacement parts that will take my machinist one half day. It's going to take my designer one full day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So as far as these things go... The **problem** is that in one-off scenarios, using existing or cheaper equipment to make stuff (if you don't have a design for it) is a cheaper solution since design is **really** expensive. *and secondly,* mass-scale production or even medium-scale assembly production beats out the cost 3D printing no problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "So effectively, 3D printing is an effective replacement for low-scale production only. Not effective for one-off replacement, not effective for replacing generics, and not effective in replacement large-scale production.\n",
      "\n",
      "-------\n",
      "\n",
      "For those reasons, I think 3D printing will not take off. The skills involved, and the cost of doing it.\n",
      "But that's exactly my point. We infact kinda made the same point. Mine just wasn't detailed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3D printing companies have been pushing the idea that 10 years from now every household will have a 3D printer and it will be the way of life. \n",

      "How many people were quoted as saying that segways would revolutionize the world? Now they're just a hobby item. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If I'm wrong then I'm wrong, I'm not going to feel bad about it. \n",
      "What was SGLB's revenues from the GE contract? I'll tell you , about $225k.  That's it.  I wipe my ass with REVENUES of $225k.  PS, their TOTAL revenues are only around $1mm, that is not PROFIT, but REVENUE.  What is their profit btw?\n",
      "Good thing I dint talk about any company and bashed the industry instead \n",
      "He's getting downvoted because SGLB is not making printers for home use. They are developing AM technology for metal printing in the aerospace industry. How quickly home 3D printing does or doesn't catch on has absolutely nothing to do with the company being discussed.\n",
      "It's not a question of if it will take off. It took off 15 years ago. Statasys has been making 3-D printers for over a decade and you'd be hard pressed to find a design engineering group that doesn't have at least one in their building. The materials and quality of parts were originally quite limiting, but that's improved to a point where some plastic parts have the appearance quality of molded plastic parts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now there's a move to more and more exotic materials in the field and I can't think they'd be working on these materials without a market for them. The companies they're frequently associated with (Honeywell, GE, etc.) make sense under those circumstances. \n",
      "I'm going to list some manufacturing advantages that you must seriously consider before dismissing additive manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "* 3D printers will work 24 hours, machinists will work 8.\n",
      "* No expensive specialty tooling.\n",
      "* QA will be done while it's being printed.\n",

      "True, I’m still kicking myself for not jumping into Aphria when I first started looking at it. Personally I Aurora is still a solid investment. I don’t see them getting bought out and last I checked they were the 2nd largest by production capacity. I think that gives them a good advantage over the short term, there’s already concerns of a massive weed shortage. Aphria has already put out a Statement saying they’re likely going to run out soon. They’ve also been making acquisitions like crazy over the past little while and own companies at every stage of the game and are planning to be involved in every part of the cannabis market. Their CEO Terry Booth has a reputation as an innovator (as I understand it, I haven’t done much research on him.) I’m still a pretty inexperienced investor but I feel confident that Aurora is going to experience solid growth over the next couple years, and at $13 a share I think it’s a steal.\n",
      "Agreed. Thanks for the response!\n",

      "DRIV is an etf that follows EVs\n",
      "Thank you very much, I'm researching these companies now to see about investments. \n",
      "I own some Aurora..def not a steal but they are uplisting soon which will help the price probably and will surely announce a deal, as will Aphria, with a tobacco or alcohol or food name. The best valuation on big LPs is Canntrust..compare their market cap/sales/patients/grams grown vs the others. The biggest gains are to be made in quality USA names with quality management and balance sheets. The new mpx/ianthus merger is superb. Cannaroyalty (changing their name today) will be a 2x or 3x within 18 months either on their own or a buy out.\n",

      "All speculation, but how do you see these potential uranium tariffs the U.S wants to enact will affect the various companies? I’m still hit or miss on the odds of it passing since it’ll likely harm the nuclear power companies themselves increasing their cost to purchase uranium, plus I just don’t know that companies like UUUU, URG, and UEC can ramp up production to meet the demands.\n",
      "Your last statement imo would actually help drive the spot price even higher, demand rising too fast while supply cant keep up will help push the spot price even higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of tarrifs, i think section 232 will benefit US uranium producers as US outsources most of its uranium needs, US companies are the ones pushing for section 232 to pass\n",
      "Yeah, you’re right there, I don’t see the uranium supply companies being hurt by this really. I guess I’m being influenced by the fact I have some interests vested in the companies running the plants themselves, which might be hurt by a squeeze. I’ll probably start building a position slowly in CAMECO along with other US mining companies the end of this month when I do my allocations. Thank you for the response.\n",

An extremely huge milestone is upon us when the KOL (key opinion leaders) provide feedback to Organovo's first commercial product (3D liver tissue assay).

      "The real problem is that there was too much hype when the reality is that 3D printing is not a viable option for 99% of manufacturinfmg from a cost or time perspective.  Its great for prototyping, or used as a tool for other manufavturing processes, but cannot compete with more traditional manufacturing processes.  Also, and this is only for 3D Systems as I have to deal with them for work, they are one of the worst run companies that ive had to deal with from a customer service perspective.\n",

      "3d printers are too unreliable and require too much skill for consumer use. It's not like paper printer where it's print and go. A 3d printer requires a ton of calibration, monitoring, etc. You need to be at least a hobbyist in order to get anything out of it and that's too much for most people. The cost and effort of making a 3d printed object is roughly close to building your own furniture. In many cases it's cheaper to buy woodworking equipment and make things out of wood.\n",

      "3d printing has the same case as wood, metal working or any other manufacturing technology- the skill and labor for entry are too high, and the people who need it are too few.\n",

      "At the time, it looked like the new frontier for manufacturing and they got hyped like cloud computing did.  3d printing is a future component but the best stocks to buy during that time are the businesses that benefit from the decreased cost of modeling them.  Then reality set in that the adoption of the product and service will end up being slow or not at all which means demands for equity dillution.  It sounded great on paper but the people benefiting are the businesses that manufacture.  \n",
      "3D printing has some uses in manufacturing, but it will be interesting to see how widespread it becomes. \n",

      "It's hard to compete with the speed of traditional manufacturing techniques if you're talking about mass production. On the other hand since tooling is \"free\" the barriers to entry will be lower for small/niche players.\n",

      "To attempt to answer OP's questions, there's many reasons the industry doesn't appear to be doing well. The biggest reason is we're on the downward slope of the hype bubble of an industry that's still in its infancy. The stock was WAY overpriced 3-4 years ago. Also, outside of the SLS technology, FDM, DMLS, EBM, etc. are still improving and most importantly have not been qualified by many large customers meaning large and consistent contracts are still fairly rare. Pair all of that with some aggressive and expensive M&As and you end of with an industry that is currently struggling to get it feet on the ground financially.\n",
      "\n",
      "True. I think where 3DP really wins is where you start producing items that were previously impossible through traditional means i.e. GE's Jet Fuel nozzles improve plume spray and efficiency in a way that no traditional technique could produce.\n",

The 3d line is just getting started for them and they expect to keep adding capabilities as they go.  That being said, they are targeting selling 10 units in the short term which at $300k a piece would not be a huge change in their bottom line.

For those that could trade, the sellers were restricted to folks that already held the stock and wanted to trade on the OTC.  Once a market maker steps up this should have some legs.

The company has established a profitable business even without 3d, this will help them pump in R&D money as needed and maintain positive earnings reports.  It is currently trading at a forward earning multiple of 31 something compared to DDD's 160 or so.  AMAVF is a similar pink sheet stock that saw significant growth over the last year so there's an example case which supports its growth.  The fact it is on a pink sheet and its extremely small float (11.5M) makes it difficult for the short sellers in the US to get ahold of it.  This will prevent a CAMT like scenario where lots of people get excited about the stock and then short sellers come in and crap on everyone's christmas.  The larger transaction fees generally dissuade a flurry of activity on this one which means there will be many more buy and hold types, I expect steady growth more like AMAVF as opposed to a meteoric rise like CAMT. As the OTC market on this one becomes more established and liquid you should see more people gravitate to GGRGF.\n",

      "The printers themselves are very unique and the company has a patent application in to keep it that way.  They are made using mobile LED lights rather than lasers.  This means that they are cheaper to manufacture and repair.  Because the heat source is mobile, they can generate much improved resolution at large and small scales. They presented recently at a conference and were an extremely popular stop.  One sale has already been reported in the three days since the conference and I would anticipate more to come.  All of these reasons, the recent buzz, the unique product, small float, cheap multiples compared to other 3d's, and a profitable business convinced me.  I don't expect it to get to DDD multiples but I do think it has plenty of room to appreciate over the next year as 3d printing continues to prove itself to the public.  \n",

Seriously, if you built a factory that can make money building panels at $0.50/watt and all of a sudden the competition is selling at $0.45/watt, you've got problems.

They have been making a bunch of worhwhile acquisitions (most recent is Phenix will which open doors in the metal 3D printing space) and have properly managed their growth.

      "\n",
      "So don't get freaked out and sell if they go down a bit in my opinion, especially this week. I think they're good for holding in the long term and will continue the generally impressive upward trend that will hopefully be reaffirmed at the next earnings release.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOWEVER - as I said, these are very volatile, and may currently be overvalued. If you're only getting 10 of each then either money is tight for you or you're just very cautious. If it's the former, these might not be the best investment because they are high risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for XONE, I looked at it when it was priced in the low 30s when I bought 3D and SSYS. I opted not to buy it because the company was leasing a lot of their patents, and had a fair bit of debt (iirc). People may be buying it because it's \"another 3D printing stock\" and not on fundamentals - so I would expect a drop after earnings if they aren't great. I haven't been following it too closely though.\n",

      "I own many shares of DDD. What makes DDD and Xone different? XONE is working with metals in 3D printing..? Definitely sounds groundbreaking. How are they as a company? I may invest. \n",
      "I was fortunate to buy DDD and SSYS last April, at $15 and $37. I've sold a modest amount of each (more of SSYS, because I didn't realize the Dec merger was not tax free and I got hammered in April with a tax bill). They are certainly at a high valuation now but they benefit from scarcity value; 3D printing is a revolution and these are the only two 3D liquid stocks you can buy. I also think the roll-up they are doing of the smaller, promising players in the industry makes them irresistible when larger players decide to enter the field. If GE decides to enter the field, it will only do so if it can become #1 or #2 in it, and it won't really care about the valuation it has to pay initially to capture that position.\n",
      "PRLB manufactures parts with injection molds or CNC machines.  It's a solid company, and they provide rapid prototyping, but they are not and never have been a 3D printer. Nor would I would say they are in the \"3D printing space\" based on how they manufacture parts. That said, they share many of the same customers as the 3D printing companies do and they have a nicer PE and balance sheet than most of them do as well.  I would buy PRLB not because it has anything to do with 3D printing, but because it is a solid company.\n",

      "Thanks for the reply Gary. I have seen that DMG Mori (MRSKY) and Evonik (EVK:GR) have their hands pretty firmly in 3d but they are more diversified companies and their bottom line is not as influenced by growth in their 3d units.  I would be interested to hear your take on them if you have had the chance to check them out.

      "That being said, my interest is obviously in increasing my portfolio and for that the price appreciation of 3d stocks are self evident.  You may argue that 3d printing stocks are a bubble and that consumer and analyst sentiment on them is incorrect but such an argument is only relevant for individuals considering buying stocks that already have growth priced in and holding long term.  This is not the strategy that I implement nor the companies that 3dprintingstocks.com generally covers.  What I am looking for are companies that are committed to this high growth industry that have not received the attention of their counterparts and therefore have PE multiples much lower than the others.  I  am trying to purchase these ahead of analyst coverage or just as it begins and hold for the duration of the most significant portion of their price appreciation.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  It has increased my portfolio over 200% in 7 months.\n",
      "3D printing has been around for decades and is heavily used in industry. The recent explosion in consumer grade printers happened because all the relevant patents ran out. The technological improvement you see in 3D printers sold to the public lags behind what industrial printers have been able to do for quite a while. The gold rush is pretty much over. Prices are tumbling due to strong competition and now even printer manufacturers like Canon and Ricoh are working on commoditizing 3D printing. There is going to be quite a bit if consolidation in this \"industry\" soon. Most 3D printing startups will go out of business are be gobbled up by the bigger fish. \n",

      "Honestly, as compelling as ONVO is in theory, starting to be concerned as there were people trying to pump it here that the reality is that it is something of a p-n-d. Too bad if that's the case. A lot of this stuff I think becomes a compelling story and the reality's a lot less. Look at Theranos recently - I hope there's really something to that, but the controversy suggests otherwise.\n",
      "DDD is well run and I think they'll end up being a player in the industry. SSYS and XONE have had some major difficulties caused by themselves which compounded the collapse in additive manufacturing stocks, whether they can fix the problems at the top or not remains to be seen. Personally, the plays I like other than DDD would be HPQ and MTLS. HPQ has the money to be the go to in this business, I'm curious to see if the new split up company can capitalize on it. At least you get some dividends there too and a damn fine pps right now (I'd still wait until after 3rd quarter earnings the week of the 23rd - 27th though). MTLS, or Materialise, provides 3D printing softwares and already have a good foothold in the industry. \n",
