      "This is a very difficult question.  At the peak of the oil prices in 2014, there was a huge push for renewable energy sources.  Additionally, the US began to enter the oil export business thanks to oil-shale production.  I think both of these trends pissed off OPEC and they decided to flush the market with oil to make alternative production (i.e. oil-shale) unprofitable and alleviate the drive for alternative energy.\n",
      "I don't think alternative energy has slowed down much (rapidly approaching levels of coal production and becoming cheaper every year), but coupled with the influx of supply and the diminishing demand from the hyper-industrialized China and US, the price is likely to stay low for the foreseeable future and not rebound as rapidly as it has in the past (many years as opposed to weeks or months).\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The current price of crude has been significantly affected by the competitive practices of several large oil nations (the Saudis are the ones that come to mind first, but the recent reductions in Iran's sanctions mean that the Iranians will likely export more oil in the near future as well).  This means that once the goal of the competitive pricing is accomplished (namely driving smaller operations like the US natural gas industry out of the arena), the prices are likely to rise again.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Though electric cars (transportation accounts for about half of oil use worldwide) are coming, it's unlikely that they will make up a significant portion of the approximately 1 billion cars on the road today.  According to [an IEA report from 2013](https://www.iea.org/publications/globalevoutlook_2013.pdf) (which I assume understates things significantly), we're looking at roughly 2% of the global passenger vehicle fleet becoming electric by 2020. What does this mean further in the future? I'm not quite sure, but I'm fairly certain that in a 10-15 year timeframe, we won't see half of the world's cars become electric.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Worldwide demand for oil is still on the rise.  According to the [IEA's Oil Reoprt](https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/), demand has risen a few percent over the past few years, despite all the talk of the emerging \"green\" economy.  This trend is likely to continue, even if the green economy takes off in developed nations, as industrialization and growth continue in the Middle East and Southeast Asia over the next decade or two (or possibly more - like I said, I'm not really an authority on all this).\n",

These classes will teach you how to solve a problem in the most efficient way possible based on how computers make sense of information.

I find the company quite peculiar in that on the one hand they have several business units that are just killing it (Aviation for example)  and on the other hand they have this albatross of GE Capital (GEC) that is suffocating them.  And I don't know what is more strange about GEC, the fact some of those \"assets\" were ever on the books in the first place, or the fact they remain after they \"sold\" said assets.  I recently went long the name so I am a little biased.  I kind of like Flannery.  He has a hard task, but I would guess from this level they pull it off credibly.  I will say I at least trust him.  He acknowledges things are all fouled up around the place and needs changing.  That is a nice break from the past.  Time will tell.  If you apply the multiple Berkshire paid for precision cast parts, I came up with a value for GE Aviation to be about 100B.

Additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry is seen purely as a massive cost reduction but the issue is that when you manufacture it using this technology there are flaws within the material that are unknown.

If a new nozzle needs to be made in Beijing they can use any 3D printer that prints to the same or better tolerances than the original printer rather than waiting for a part to fly in from Ohio, all they need is the original CAD and QA files from GE.

The 3d line is just getting started for them and they expect to keep adding capabilities as they go.  That being said, they are targeting selling 10 units in the short term which at $300k a piece would not be a huge change in their bottom line.

For those that could trade, the sellers were restricted to folks that already held the stock and wanted to trade on the OTC.  Once a market maker steps up this should have some legs.

The company has established a profitable business even without 3d, this will help them pump in R&D money as needed and maintain positive earnings reports.  It is currently trading at a forward earning multiple of 31 something compared to DDD's 160 or so.  AMAVF is a similar pink sheet stock that saw significant growth over the last year so there's an example case which supports its growth.  The fact it is on a pink sheet and its extremely small float (11.5M) makes it difficult for the short sellers in the US to get ahold of it.  This will prevent a CAMT like scenario where lots of people get excited about the stock and then short sellers come in and crap on everyone's christmas.  The larger transaction fees generally dissuade a flurry of activity on this one which means there will be many more buy and hold types, I expect steady growth more like AMAVF as opposed to a meteoric rise like CAMT. As the OTC market on this one becomes more established and liquid you should see more people gravitate to GGRGF.\n",

      "The printers themselves are very unique and the company has a patent application in to keep it that way.  They are made using mobile LED lights rather than lasers.  This means that they are cheaper to manufacture and repair.  Because the heat source is mobile, they can generate much improved resolution at large and small scales. They presented recently at a conference and were an extremely popular stop.  One sale has already been reported in the three days since the conference and I would anticipate more to come.  All of these reasons, the recent buzz, the unique product, small float, cheap multiples compared to other 3d's, and a profitable business convinced me.  I don't expect it to get to DDD multiples but I do think it has plenty of room to appreciate over the next year as 3d printing continues to prove itself to the public.  \n",

CIMT is probably worth it in the long run, but it's hard to say if ONVO will ever accomplish their lofty goals. I sure hope they can though, it's worth reading up on all they do. Cool stuff! One last stock to consider if you want to swing for the fences, SGLB (more on /r/SGLB) is partnered up with some solid companies and has a software that can help everyone in the 3D market. It's risky as hell, but if they succeed in launching PrintRite3D and it's well embraced by the industry as I think it will be, the eagle is going to seriously fly here. Hope that helps, and sorry I didn't have time to go into more about each company but you can research them each and find out what works for you. \n",
      "SGLB.  Any good news with this company within the next few weeks will send the stock price back up to 0.18 or higher.  No news or bad news it will slowly sink back down to 0.1 or lower over the next couple months.  From someone who has done hands on research in industries with which require very precise manufacturing tolerances and a very big focus on quality, I personally see huge potential in SGLB's work within the emerging world of additive manufacturing.  I have more than just play money invested in this one.\n",

It has untill Feb 28 to retrace 12% where I will have doubled my money. I thought the odds were good for it to accomplish that.

      "DDD : Overvalued in comparison to it's peers (such as SSYS), though it has a more diverse arsenal. Their printers don't have great reviews and even their company has mediocre reviews on sites such as Glassdoor. Despites all those facts, they are all over the media and are going to keep attracting a lot of hype, I'm positive the stock will keep going up and own shares of it.\n",

      "SSYS : Very good buy in my opinion, they're more conservative, they specialized in certain products, but they get great results. They have less hype as a result, but they are closer to being fairly valued and are a less risky bet.\n",
      "3D Printing has the opportunity to expand widely in the near future.  Out of the three companies you've listed Stratasys (487M revenue in 2014) is the most stable.  It has a lower market cap than 3D systems (513M revenue in 2014) and in my opinion is the industry leader.  Stratasys has also acquired MakerBot which if the commerical expansion of 3D printing becomes viable, will cause the stock's value to explode.  \n",

      "Organovo is speculative at best right now.  It is on a totally different level than SSYS and DDD.  I have a small stake in the company and firmly believe that the management is capable of creating something unique.  However, the company hasn't posted any profit since its inception and is acquiring only small amounts of revenue through collaborations.  An extremely huge milestone is upon us when the KOL (key opinion leaders) provide feedback to Organovo's first commercial product (3D liver tissue assay).  If the feedback is positive for this product, you should expect to see a nice pop in the price.  Organovo has a wide variety of other tissues its expecting to eventually print for testing.

Moreover, there is a limited-to-nonexistent secondary mortgage market meaning the banks generally hold the loans they make (MBSs are still an option). Mortgages in Aus are generally 5 or 7 year ARMs which means a rise in interest rates or drop in property values from new lending regulations, or changes to the tax code such as a change in negative gearing, could drastically harm the bank’s balance sheets and cash flow. \n",

      "Bcaz many foreign markets have higher yields than the 2&#37; or so on the S&P 500. Very high dividend yields like with the Aussie banks are a bit rare but still understandable since Australia is known for high payouts and the concept of franking credits to dividends. Others like Canadian banks do not have very high yields. Banks in Chile and Colombia for example have higher yields than the US because they are emerging markets and Chilean firms have to payout a good portion of earnings as dividends by law. So I would analyze the reason for higher dividends than assuming very high dividends are not a concern.\n",

Austrian economists would agree that there is only a slight chance for a rate hike considering the circumstances of the economy. Yellen had bluffed many times before, and the time in March would not have been any different considering the economic fundamentals at the time. While the market had bet that they would either raise or speak of raising it soon, it was the opposite.

I prefer ATM if/when I do anything these days.  Back then I did plenty of earnings plays, but I am very much against that now as the premiums are too high.  It's better to buy AFTER earnings these days on stocks that aren't moving as high/low as they should be... buying before too many large funds add much of it to their portfolios as they see the company gaining traction ahead of estimates.

The other issue involves the political aspect of China and how much of an influence/impact (positively or negatively) Xi Jinping was have on their markets.

This can be a good thing because it allows them to cherry pick patients who may have favorable outcomes and limited AE’s. It can also be a bad thing too.

They bought Kite and you saw the bounce from that, then I think people realized that the growth from that wouldn't be seen for a long while and people fled again and now you have a stock back near two year lows. Celgene and Gilead really show that the second biotechs start to stall people just flee. REGN is another - that's back where it was about 4 years ago. You mention GILD and CELG, but there's not a whole lot that's great in large cap pharma/biotech broadly and the question becomes what is the catalyst to change that; you look at a Gilead and some other names that have been in a downturn for a while now.\n",
