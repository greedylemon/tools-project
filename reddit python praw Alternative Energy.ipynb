Seriously, if you built a factory that can make money building panels at $0.50/watt and all of a sudden the competition is selling at $0.45/watt, you've got problems.

Additionally, the US began to enter the oil export business thanks to oil-shale production.  I think both of these trends pissed off OPEC and they decided to flush the market with oil to make alternative production (i.e. oil-shale) unprofitable and alleviate the drive for alternative energy.\n",

      "1. The current price of crude has been significantly affected by the competitive practices of several large oil nations (the Saudis are the ones that come to mind first, but the recent reductions in Iran's sanctions mean that the Iranians will likely export more oil in the near future as well).  This means that once the goal of the competitive pricing is accomplished (namely driving smaller operations like the US natural gas industry out of the arena), the prices are likely to rise again.\n",

      "2. Though electric cars (transportation accounts for about half of oil use worldwide) are coming, it's unlikely that they will make up a significant portion of the approximately 1 billion cars on the road today.  According to [an IEA report from 2013](https://www.iea.org/publications/globalevoutlook_2013.pdf) (which I assume understates things significantly), we're looking at roughly 2% of the global passenger vehicle fleet becoming electric by 2020. What does this mean further in the future? I'm not quite sure, but I'm fairly certain that in a 10-15 year timeframe, we won't see half of the world's cars become electric.\n",

These classes will teach you how to solve a problem in the most efficient way possible based on how computers make sense of information.

They could be potentially be a very rewarding stock to own if they do turn things around and you are willing to be patient or they could perhaps just as easily continue their slow decline before finally going out or being broken apart.\n",

      "Agree GE will be (or should be) taught in all the business schools.  I find the company quite peculiar in that on the one hand they have several business units that are just killing it (Aviation for example)  and on the other hand they have this albatross of GE Capital (GEC) that is suffocating them.  And I don't know what is more strange about GEC, the fact some of those \"assets\" were ever on the books in the first place, or the fact they remain after they \"sold\" said assets.  I recently went long the name so I am a little biased.  I kind of like Flannery.  He has a hard task, but I would guess from this level they pull it off credibly.  I will say I at least trust him.  He acknowledges things are all fouled up around the place and needs changing.  That is a nice break from the past.  Time will tell.  If you apply the multiple Berkshire paid for precision cast parts, I came up with a value for GE Aviation to be about 100B.  Additive manufacturing, Life Sciences, Aviation, Digital, all have some tail winds.  Hopefully they can figure themselves out.  We'll see....    \n"

With more and more areas getting things like Amazon Now, is there a point where there's more and more overlap of what Amazon can bring you in bulk? Costco's focus has never been online and while they are apparently working with Google Express to some degree, Costco has seemed to be proudly low-tech (it took a while before they had one barcode for the coupon book and the app, you used to have to sit there and rip out coupons one by one) all this time.\n",

Yeah, services like Amazon will increasingly be able to deliver quickly to everyone, but I gotta say I just think the whole \"I have to drive to get anything or do anything\" thing is going to become increasingly out of favor. I also think there will be in the future more people asking \"What do I really need?\" when it comes to a house. Does the smaller place (that costs less to maintain) in the more convenient location start to really win out against the huge house that isn't convenient to anything and is more costly to maintain? This does kind of go along with the move towards urban living or near-urban living (as I think rents in many major cities at this point are absurd) - people are going to want to have more and more amenities and conveniences at hand. I am concerned at this point about apartment REITs with high concentration in major cities, like Equity Residential (EQR), but longer-term I think you have appealing assets in markets with a high barrier to entry.
